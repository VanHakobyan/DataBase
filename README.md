<h2>Entity Framework</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Entity Framework</b> (EF) is an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" title="Object-relational mapping">object-relational mapping</a> (ORM) framework for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET" title="ADO.NET">ADO.NET</a>. It was a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" title=".NET Framework">.NET Framework</a>, but since Entity framework version 6 it is separated from .NET framework.<p/>
<p>The Entity Framework is a set of technologies in ADO.NET that support the development of data-oriented software applications. Architects and developers of data-oriented applications have typically struggled with the need to achieve two very different objectives. They must model the entities, relationships, and logic of the business problems they are solving, and they must also work with the data engines used to store and retrieve the data. The data may span multiple storage systems, each with its own protocols; even applications that work with a single storage system must balance the requirements of the storage system against the requirements of writing efficient and maintainable application code.</p>
<p>The Entity Framework enables developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects and properties, such as customers and customer addresses, without having to concern themselves with the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With the Entity Framework, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code than in traditional applications. Because the Entity Framework is a component of the .NET Framework, Entity Framework applications can run on any computer on which the .NET Framework (starting with version 3.5 SP1) is installed.</p>

<h2>SQL</h2>
<hr>
<p>SQL  (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).</p>
<p>Originally based upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra" title="Relational algebra">relational algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_relational_calculus" title="Tuple relational calculus">tuple relational calculus</a>, SQL consists of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language" title="Data definition language">data definition language</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language" title="Data manipulation language">data manipulation language</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language" title="Data control language">data control language</a>. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, <a href="/wiki/Database_schema" title="Database schema">schema</a> creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming" title="Declarative programming">declarative language</a> (<a href="/wiki/4GL" class="mw-redirect" title="4GL">4GL</a>), it also includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural programming">procedural</a> elements.</p>

<h2>ADO.NET</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>ADO.NET</b> is a data access technology from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" title=".NET Framework">.NET Framework</a> that provides communication between relational and non-relational systems through a common set of components. ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from the database. It is a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Class_Library" class="mw-redirect" title="Base Class Library">base class library</a> that is included with the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is commonly used by programmers to access and modify data stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_DBMS" class="mw-redirect" title="Relational DBMS">relational database systems</a>, though it can also access data in non-relational sources. ADO.NET is sometimes considered an evolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX_Data_Objects" title="ActiveX Data Objects">ActiveX Data Objects</a> (ADO) technology, but was changed so extensively that it can be considered an entirely new product.</p>
